                            <p>We've seen a thing or two in the past half century! established in 1956 by Jack and Rose Miller, has been serving up the perfect blend of nostalgia and flavor for decades. Inspired by the lively atmosphere of the 1950s, the couple envisioned a place where friends could gather, enjoy great whiskey, and snack on delicious bites without the fuss of a full meal. Jack, a whiskey connoisseur, and Rose, a creative chef, focused on perfecting a menu of irresistible bar snacks — from crispy fries to savory sliders and everything in between. </p>
                            <p>Over the years, their vision evolved into a cozy haven where guests can unwind with expertly paired drinks and crave-worthy bites. Though the menu has stayed true to its roots, Whiskey Business remains a place where good times, laughter, and unforgettable flavors are always on the menu. Whether you’re here for a quick snack with friends or a relaxed evening, we invite you to be part of the story that Jack and Rose started all those years ago.</p>
